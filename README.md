# Planning Environmentally Friendly Travel

Hasan Selman Kara

This project is an interactive eco-friendly trip planner that shows the carbon footprint different itineraries 
will leave with different modes of transportation.
Allowing me to make better decisions.

## Context

Next year I will embark on a year long world trip. 
Being somewhat environmentally conscious, I want to leave a small carbon footprint behind.
Therefore, I want to know **which itinerary with which mode of transportation is the best** for my journey and how big 
my carbon footprint is.

## Technical information
**Main file path**: index.html

- index.html  // mandatory entry point to your app
- src         // my js files
- css	      // my css files
- lib         // js libraries
- data        // your data, if local
- img         // images, movies, etc.

### Installation
We cannot simply open HTML files in the browser because we load local data.
Therefore, we install a small http-server with npm.

`npm install http-server -g`

Now we can simply run: `http-server` and visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/

## Status
Change to yes when you are ready.

| Version               | Status |

| First prototype ready | Yes    |
| Final version ready   | No     |
